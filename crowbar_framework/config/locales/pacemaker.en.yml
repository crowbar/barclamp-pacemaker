        drbd_header: DRBD
        drbd:
          info: Using DRBD for replicated storage is an alternative to using shared storage for high availability of services like database and RabbitMQ. This requires the cluster to have two nodes only, as well as one dedicated disk on each cluster member.
          enabled: Prepare cluster for DRBD
        haproxy_header: HAProxy
        haproxy:
          ssl_info:
            'The hostname for each virtual IP of HAProxy is generated by
            prefixing the name of the network to "%{vhostname}". For instance,
            the hostname of the admin virtual IP will be "admin.%{vhostname}".
            If using SSL for services that will be served behind HAProxy, then
            the SSL certificates will have to be valid for the hostname of the
            virtual IP for each network being used (in general, admin and
            public), and for the public name if defined.'
          public_name: Public name for public virtual IP
          public_name_hint:
            The public name is the hostname that will be used instead of the
            generated public name for the public virtual IP of HAProxy (when
            registering public endpoints, for instance). Any name specified
            here should already exist in the upstream DNS zones.
        gui_header: Pacemaker GUI
        setup_hawk: Setup web GUI (Hawk)
        setup_hb_gui: Setup non-web GUI (hb_gui)
        hb_gui_hint:
          If this is changed to true after cluster startup, each node in
          the cluster requires the Pacemaker service to be restarted in order
          to make the GUI accessible.
        corosync:
          password: Password for hacluster user in Hawk
        crm:
          no_quorum_policy: Policy when cluster does not have quorum
          no_quorum_policy_hint: 'Refer to the <a href="http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_available_cluster_options.html">pacemaker documentation</a> for a description of each value.'
        stonith_header: STONITH
        stonith_modes:
          manual: Configured manually
          ipmi_barclamp: Configured with IPMI data from IPMI barclamp
          shared: Configured with one shared resource for the whole cluster
          per_node: Configured with one resource per node
          libvirt: Configured for nodes running in libvirt
        stonith:
          mode: Configuration mode for STONITH
          no_nodes: No nodes have been assigned a pacemaker role.

          libvirt:
            dev_only: The libvirt STONITH configuration is not supported, it should be used for development or testing purposes only!
            hypervisor_ip: IP address of hypervisor
            hypervisor_ip_hint: Note that libvirt on your host needs to be configured to listen on TCP, with no TLS and no authentication. The firewall should also be configured to allow communication from the virtual machines.

          smtp:
            enabled: Enable Mail Notifications
